# Phase 1 Status Update

## Important Discovery

During implementation, we discovered that **Zed's Extension API currently has limited support for custom commands**. The API primarily supports:

1. **Language Server integration** - For syntax highlighting, diagnostics, etc.
2. **Grammar definitions** - For custom language support
3. **Themes** - For color schemes

**Custom command palette commands** (like `openspec:init`, `openspec:new-proposal`) are not yet supported in the stable Extension API.

## What This Means

### Current Extension (Phase 1 - Minimal)
The extension now provides:
- ‚úÖ Basic extension scaffolding
- ‚úÖ Foundation for future LSP integration
- ‚úÖ Compiles successfully to WASM
- ‚úÖ Loads in Zed without errors

### What's NOT Included (Yet)
- ‚ùå Command palette integration
- ‚ùå `openspec:init` and other commands
- ‚ùå OpenSpec CLI wrapper functionality

These features depend on Zed adding custom command support to their Extension API.

## Revised Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (CURRENT - Simplified)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- Minimal working extension
- Compiles to WASM
- Loads in Zed
- Foundation for LSP

### Phase 2: Language Server Protocol
**Status**: üöß Next Up
- Implement LSP server for `.md` files in `openspec/` directories
- Real-time spec validation
- Inline diagnostics
- Syntax highlighting for spec deltas

**Why this matters**: This provides immediate value by validating specs as you write them.

### Phase 3: Slash Commands (When Available)
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting on Zed API
- Implement slash commands (`/openspec-init`, `/openspec-proposal`, etc.)
- These work in chat/command areas
- Alternative to command palette until full command support arrives

### Phase 4+: Full Feature Set
When Zed adds full command palette support:
- All originally planned commands
- LLM integration
- Audit trail
- Coverage analysis

## How to Use Current Extension

### Installation
```bash
./install-macos.sh  # macOS
# or
./install.sh        # Linux

# Build
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1

# Install in Zed
# Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "zed: install dev extension" ‚Üí select directory
```

### What You'll See
After installing, the extension will:
- ‚úÖ Load successfully
- ‚úÖ Show in Extensions panel
- ‚úÖ Print initialization message in Zed's log

### What You WON'T See (Yet)
- ‚ùå No commands in command palette (API limitation)
- ‚ùå No OpenSpec functionality yet

## Alternative: OpenSpec CLI Direct Usage

Until Zed's Extension API supports commands, use OpenSpec CLI directly:

```bash
# In your project terminal
openspec init
openspec proposal my-feature
openspec apply my-feature
```

Then edit specs in Zed, and the extension will be ready to provide LSP validation (Phase 2).

## Next Steps

### For Users
1. **Install the minimal extension** - It works, just doesn't do much yet
2. **Use OpenSpec CLI directly** - Full functionality available
3. **Wait for Phase 2** - LSP validation will be very useful
4. **Watch for Zed API updates** - Command support may be added

### For Developers
1. **Focus on Phase 2**: LSP implementation will provide real value
2. **Keep command handlers**: They're ready for when API supports it
3. **Consider slash commands**: May be available before full command palette
4. **Stay updated**: Watch Zed's extension API developments

## Technical Details

### What Changed
**Before**: Full command integration attempted
```rust
fn command(&mut self, command: String, ...) -> Result<String>
// ‚ùå This method doesn't exist in Extension trait
```

**After**: Minimal valid implementation
```rust
fn new() -> Self { Self }
fn language_server_command(...) -> Result<Command>
// ‚úÖ These are the actual trait methods
```

### Why the Error Occurred
The original implementation tried to use `command()` method which doesn't exist in Zed's `Extension` trait. The actual trait only has:
- `new()` - Initialize extension
- `language_server_command()` - Provide LSP configuration

### Files Structure (Simplified)
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs                 # Minimal extension (20 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/              # Ready for future use
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                 # Ready for future use
```

## The Good News

1. **LSP Support Works**: We can still build real-time validation (Phase 2)
2. **Code is Ready**: All command handlers are implemented, just waiting for API
3. **Foundation Solid**: Extension compiles and loads correctly
4. **CLI Works Now**: OpenSpec CLI provides all functionality today

## Comparison: What Works vs. Planned

| Feature | Originally Planned | Current Status | When Available |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Extension loads | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Now |
| LSP validation | Phase 2 | Phase 2 | Next |
| Syntax highlighting | Phase 2 | Phase 2 | Next |
| Command palette commands | Phase 1 | ‚ùå Blocked | When Zed adds API |
| Slash commands | Not planned | Maybe | If Zed adds support |
| LLM integration | Phase 3 | Phase 3+ | After commands work |
| Audit trail | Phase 4 | Phase 4+ | After commands work |

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update README to reflect current limitations
- [ ] Add "Waiting on Zed API" status badge
- [ ] Update installation guide expectations
- [ ] Add workaround (use CLI directly)
- [ ] Phase 2 focus shift to LSP

## Conclusion

This is a **strategic pause**, not a failure. The extension framework is solid, but we're waiting on Zed's Extension API to mature. In the meantime:

1. **Phase 2 (LSP)** provides real value
2. **Direct CLI usage** works perfectly today
3. **Extension foundation** is ready for when API expands

The code we wrote isn't wasted - it's ready and waiting for Zed to enable it!

---

**Status**: Foundation complete, moving to LSP implementation
**Next**: Focus on Phase 2 - Real-time spec validation via LSP
